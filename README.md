# KeepTheBall

   This is my first project in C# and Unity.
   
   The project can be said to be "in production")) You can look at it on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kopeapps.KeepTheBall">GooglePlay</a> (or maybe download and play it if you are an Android owner ðŸ™ƒ)

  I finished working on it back in 2017. 
  The project was uploaded here in the form in which it was at the time of the last update. 
  You can view the C# code directly in the folder <a href="https://github.com/vlbondarenko/KeepTheBall/tree/master/Assets/Scripties">KeepTheBall/Assets/Scripties</a>.
  
  And yes, there is a typo in the folder name ðŸ™‚. I left everything as it was... ðŸ™„
